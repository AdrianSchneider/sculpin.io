# Documentation

Until Sculpin has more formal documentation it is best to "learn by example."
First, [download Sculpin][1], then check out the [Sculpin blog skeleton][2]
(instructions in the README) to quickly fire up a basic Sculpin powered blog.

After that, check out the list of sites powered by Sculpin on the [home page][3]
for sites that have their source published. There should be a lot of great ideas
there! Have questions? Ask the Sculpin [community!][4]
