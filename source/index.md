# Launching Soon!

Sculpin is a static site generator built around some incredible PHP tools &mdash;
primarily [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) (various components),
[Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) (default formatter),
and [Composer](http://packagist.org) (bundle manager).

Want to get involved? Check out the Sculpin [community]({{site.url}}/community)!


## Project Status

Sculpin is currently under development and is really only usable for people
willing to work with code that is considered **unstable** and lacks documentation.
Sculpin people are ready to help, though, so please try to get in contact with
the Sculpin [community]({{site.url}}) so we can work together!

But please, do not let this scare you away. Sculpin **is** usable.
[This site](https://github.com/sculpin/getsculpin.com) is currently generated
by Sculpin. Hurray for being self-hosted! This was a huge milestone.

Check the [documentation]({{site.url}}/documentation) to see how this site is
generated.
