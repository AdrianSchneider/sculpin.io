# Launching Soon!

Sculpin is a static site generator built around some incredible PHP tools &mdash;
primarily [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) (various components),
[Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) (default formatter),
and [Composer](http://packagist.org) (bundle manager).

Want to get involved? Check out the Sculpin [community]({{site.url}}/community)!


## Project Status

Sculpin is currently under development. Sculpin is currently only usable  for people
willing to work with code that is considered **alpha** and documentation that is
more or less nonexistent.

It *is* usable, though. [This site](https://github.com/sculpin/getsculpin.com) is
currently generated by Sculpin. Hurray for being self-hosted! This was a huge milestone.
