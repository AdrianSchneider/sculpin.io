# Launching Soon!

Sculpin is a static site generator built around some incredible PHP tools &mdash;
primarily [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) (various components),
[Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) (default formatter),
and [Composer](http://packagist.org) (bundle manager).

## Project Status

Sculpin is currently under active development. There are some early builds available
for [download]({{site.url}}/download) but they should be considered **alpha** and the
documentation should be considered nonexistent. It *is* usable, though.
[This site](https://github.com/sculpin/getsculpin.com) is currently generated by Sculpin.
Hurray for being self-hosted! This is a huge milestone.
